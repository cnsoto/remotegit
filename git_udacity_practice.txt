Princess little sugar

So many hands to hold you
so many eyes to see you grow up
There no doubt you are strong, and 
as same as you we are ansious to
see you run. So go my baby and run.

Mo petit fille
Je mangeons pain, la viande et boivent soda 
Bonjour bonne femme
Mon noir chien mange de la viande et de l'eau
